# ECommerce-Customer-Segmentation

Businesses must comprehend consumer behaviours in the cutthroat world of eCommerce to create winning marketing campaigns and improve client retention. Based on three important metrics—recentness (the amount of time since a customer made a purchase), frequency (the frequency with which a customer makes a purchase), and monetary value (the total monetary value of a customer's purchases) — RFM analysis, a customer segmentation technique, offers insightful information about customer purchasing patterns. Businesses may better target their marketing efforts at client groups and increase customer engagement, retention, and income by segmenting their customer base according to their RFM ratings.
